## Some Tips and Tricks for Playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
 
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a game that requires skill, strategy, and creativity. Whether you are playing the single-player mode or the multiplayer mode, you will need to master the art of stealth, combat, and parkour. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you improve your game and have more fun.

- Use your eagle vision often. Eagle vision is a special ability that allows you to see your enemies, allies, and objectives in different colors. It can help you identify your targets, plan your attacks, and avoid detection. You can activate it by pressing the right stick on your controller or the V key on your keyboard.
- Upgrade your equipment and skills. As you progress through the game, you will earn money and experience points that you can use to buy new weapons, armor, and gadgets from shops or blacksmiths. You can also upgrade your skills by completing challenges or training with your fellow assassins. Upgrading your equipment and skills will make you more powerful and versatile in combat and stealth.
- Recruit and train assassins. One of the new features of Brotherhood is the ability to recruit and train other assassins to join your cause. You can recruit them by saving them from the Borgia or by completing certain missions. You can then send them on contracts across Europe to earn money and experience, or call them for assistance during your missions. You can also customize their appearance, weapons, and skills.
- Explore the city and collectibles. Rome is a huge and beautiful city that offers many opportunities for exploration and discovery. You can climb the famous landmarks, such as the Coliseum or the Pantheon, or find hidden treasures and secrets in the underground tunnels. You can also collect various items, such as feathers, flags, glyphs, or paintings, that can unlock rewards or reveal more about the game's lore.
- Try out the multiplayer mode. Brotherhood is the first game in the series to feature a multiplayer mode that lets you compete with other players online. The multiplayer mode has several modes, such as Wanted, where you have to hunt down your assigned targets while avoiding being killed by your pursuers; or Alliance, where teams of two have to cooperate to eliminate their rivals. The multiplayer mode is tense and thrilling, as players have to blend in with the crowd, use their abilities wisely, and outsmart their opponents.

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a game that offers a lot of content and variety for players of all tastes and preferences. By following these tips and tricks, you can enhance your game experience and enjoy the game even more.
